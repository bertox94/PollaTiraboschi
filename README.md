# Software Engineering II
This repo contains all the material about the project of the Software Engineering II course @Polimi (AA2020/21)

Given a real world scenario, the focus is to produce:
* [Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD)](https://github.com/bertox94/PollaTiraboschi/blob/master/DeliveryFolder/RASD.pdf)
* [Design Document (DD)](https://github.com/bertox94/PollaTiraboschi/blob/master/DeliveryFolder/DD.pdf)
* [Alloy Model](https://github.com/bertox94/PollaTiraboschi/blob/master/DeliveryFolder/Alloy%20model.als) (software based behavioural simulation of the final application)
